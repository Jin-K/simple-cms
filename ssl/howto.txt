To create new self-trusted certificate on linux for Chrome, follow this tutorial:
https://andrewlock.net/creating-and-trusting-a-self-signed-certificate-on-linux-for-use-in-kestrel-and-asp-net-core/

In Firefox (once you're done with the step here above), you can do this 3 times (for each https url) :
Preferences -> Privacy & Security -> Security -> Certificates -> View certificates -> Servers -> Add exception ->  add exceptions in the settings
type : https://localhost:44300 or https://localhost:44321 or https://localhost:44385 and click on Get certificate
check "Permanently store this exception" and click on "Confirm Security Exception"
After you've done this for the 3 urls, you can click on the OK button of the "Certificate Manager" popup
